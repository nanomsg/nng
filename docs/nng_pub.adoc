NAME
----
nng_pub - publisher protocol

SYNOPSIS
--------

[source,c]
----------
#include <nng/protocol/pubsub0/pub.h>

int nng_pub0_open(nng_socket *s);
----------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _nng_pub_ protocol is one half of a publisher/subscriber pattern.
In this pattern, a publisher sends data, which is broadcast to all
subscribers.  The subscribing applications only see the data to which
they have subscribed.

The _nng_pub_ protocol is the publisher side, and the
<<nng_sub#,nng_sub(7)>> protocol is the subscriber side.

NOTE: In this implementation, the publisher delivers all messages to all
subscribers. The subscribers maintain their own subscriptions, and filter
them locally.  Thus, this pattern should not be used in an attempt to
reduce bandwidth consumption.

The topics that subscribers subscribe to is just the first part of
the message body.  Applications should construct their messages
accordingly.

Socket Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `nng_pub0_open()` call creates a publisher socket.  This socket
may be used to send messages, but is unable to receive them.  Attempts
to receive messages will result in `NNG_ENOTSUP`.

Protocol Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only version 0 of this protocol is supported.  (At the time of writing,
no other versions of this protocol have been defined.)

Protocol Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _nng_pub_ protocol has no protocol-specific options.

Protocol Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _nng_pub_ protocol has no protocol-specific headers.
