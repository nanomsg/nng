== NAME

nng_mtx_unlock - unlock mutex

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/util/platform.h>

void nng_mtx_unlock(nng_mtx *mtx);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_mtx_unlock()` relinquishes ownership of the mutex _mtx_ that
was previously acquired via `<<nng_mtx_lock.3supp#,nng_mtx_lock()>>`.

IMPORTANT: A mutex can _only_ be unlocked by the thread that locked it.
Attempting to unlock a mutex that is not owned by the caller will result
in undefined behavior.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

None.
