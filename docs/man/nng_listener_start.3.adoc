== NAME

nng_listener_start - start listener

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_listener_start(nng_listener l, int flags);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_listener_start()` function starts the listener _l_.

This causes the listener to bind to the address it was created with,
and to start accepting connections from remote
dialers.
Each new connection results in an <<nng_pipe.5#,`nng_pipe`>> object,
which will be attached to the listener's socket.

Normally, the act of "`binding`" to it's address is done
synchronously, including any necessary name resolution.
As a result,
a failure, such as if the address is already in use, will be returned
immediately.
However, if the special value `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK` is
supplied in _flags_, then this is done asynchronously; furthermore any
failure to bind will be periodically reattempted in the background.

TIP: While `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK` can help an application be more resilient,
it also generally makes diagnosing failures somewhat more difficult.

Once a listener has started, it is generally not possible to change
it's configuration.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

`NNG_ECLOSED`:: Parameter _l_ does not refer to an open listener.
`NNG_ESTATE`:: The listener _l_ is already started.
