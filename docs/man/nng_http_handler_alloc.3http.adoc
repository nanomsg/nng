== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_http_handler_alloc()` family of functions allocate a handler
which will be used to process requests coming into an HTTP server.
On success, a pointer to the handler is stored at the located pointed to
by _hp_.

Every handler has a Request-URI to which it refers, which is determined
by the _path_ argument.
Only the path component of the Request URI is
considered when determining whether the handler should be called.

Additionally each handler has a method it is registered to handle
(the default is `GET`, see
`<<nng_http_handler_set_method.3http#,nng_http_handler_set_method()>>`), and
optionally a 'Host' header it can be matched against (see
`<<nng_http_handler_set_host.3http#,nng_http_handler_set_host()>>`).

In some cases, a handler may reference a logical tree rather (directory)
rather than just a single element.
(See `<<nng_http_handler_set_tree.3http#,nng_http_handler_set_tree()>>`).

=== Custom Handler

The generic (first) form of this creates a handler that uses a user-supplied
function to process HTTP requests.
This function uses the asynchronous I/O framework.
The function takes a pointer to an `<<nng_aio.5#,nng_aio>>` structure.

The _aio_ will be passed with the following input values (retrieved with
`<<nng_aio_get_input.3#,nng_aio_get_input()>>`):

   0: `nng_http_req *` __request__:: The client's HTTP request.
   1: `nng_http_handler *` __handler__:: Pointer to the handler object.
   2: `nng_http_conn *` __conn__:: The underlying HTTP connection.

The handler should create an `nng_http_res *` response (such as via
`<<nng_http_res_alloc.3http#,nng_http_res_alloc()>>` or
`<<nng_http_res_alloc_error.3http#,nng_http_res_alloc_error()>>`) and store that
in as the first output (index 0) with
`<<nng_aio_set_output.3#,nng_aio_set_output()>>`.

Alternatively, the handler may send the HTTP response (and any associated
body data) itself using the connection.
In that case the output at index 0 of the _aio_ should be NULL.

Finally, using the `<<nng_aio_finish.3#,nng_aio_finish()>>` function, the
_aio_ should be completed successfully.
If any non-zero status is returned back to the caller instead,
then a generic 500 response will be created and
sent, if possible, and the connection will be closed.

The _aio_ may be scheduled for deferred completion using the
`<<nng_aio_defer.3#,nng_aio_defer()>>` function.

NOTE: The callback function should *NOT* call
`<<nng_aio_begin.3#,nng_aio_begin()>>`,
as that will already have been done by the server framework.

=== Directory Handler

The second member of this family, `nng_http_handler_alloc_directory()`, creates
a handler configured to serve a directory tree.
The _uri_ is taken as the root, and files are served from the directory
tree rooted at _path_.

When the client Request-URI resolves to a directory in the file system,
the handler looks first for a file named `index.html` or `index.htm`.
If one is found, then that file is returned back to the client.
If no such index file exists, then an `NNG_HTTP_STATUS_NOT_FOUND` (404) error is
sent back to the client.

The `Content-Type` will be set automatically based upon the extension
of the requested file name.
If a content type cannot be determined from
the extension, then `application/octet-stream` is used.

=== File Handler

The third member of this family, `nng_http_handler_alloc_file()`, creates
a handler to serve up a single file; it does not traverse directories
or search for `index.html` or `index.htm` files.

The `Content-Type` will be set automatically based upon the extension
of the requested file name.
If a content type cannot be determined from
the extension, then `application/octet-stream` is used.

=== Redirect Handler

The fourth member is used to arrange for a server redirect from one
URL to another.
The reply will be with status code __status__, which should be a 3XX
code such as 301, and a `Location:` header will contain the URL
referenced by __location__, with any residual suffix from the request
URI appended.

TIP: Use `<<nng_http_handler_set_tree#,nng_http_handler_set_tree()>>`
to redirect an entire tree.
For example, it is possible to redirect an entire HTTP site to another
HTTPS site by specifying `/` as the path and then using the base
of the new site, such as `https://newsite.example.com` as the
new location.

TIP: Be sure to use the appropriate value for __status__.
Permanent redirection should use 301 and temporary redirections should use 307.
In REST APIs, using a redirection to supply the new location of an object
created with `POST` should use 303.

=== Static Handler

The fifth member of this family, `nng_http_handler_alloc_static()`, creates
a handler to serve up fixed content located in program data.
The client is
sent the _data_, with `Content-Length` of _size_ bytes, and `Content-Type` of
__content_type__.

== RETURN VALUES

These functions return 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`NNG_EINVAL`:: An invalid _path_ was specified.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient free memory exists to allocate a message.
`NNG_ENOTSUP`:: No support for HTTP in the library.
