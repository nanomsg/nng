== NAME

nng_iov - scatter/gather element

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

typedef struct {
    void * iov_buf;
    size_t iov_len;
} nng_iov;
----

== DESCRIPTION

An `nng_iov` structure represents a single element in a ((scatter/gather))
array.
Some operations can use arrays of these to access different regions of
memory in a single operation.
For example, it may be useful to send a message with header data from
one part of memory, and a user payload from another.

The operations that do this typically store an array of these in
an <<nng_aio.5#,`nng_aio`>> structure using the
<<nng_aio_set_iov.3#,`nng_aio_set_iov()`>> function.

The following structure members are present:

`iov_buf`::
    This is a pointer to the first byte within the memory being
    referenced by this scatter/gather element.

`iov_len`::
    This is the size in bytes of this scatter/gather element.
