== NAME

nng_tls_config_own_cert - configure own certificate and key

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/tls/tls.h>

int nng_tls_config_own_cert(nni_tls_config *cfg, const char *cert,
    const char *key, const char *pass);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_tls_config_own_cert()` function configures a certificate _cert_
identifying the local side of a TLS connection used with _cfg_, along with an
associated private or secret key _key_.
The certificate may be
a chain, with the leaf signer first and the root at the end.  The
self-signed certificate at the end can be omitted.
(The client should already
have it, and will have to in order to validate this certificate anyway).

The _key_ may be encrypted with a password, in which can be supplied in _pass_.
The value `NULL` should be supplied for _pass_ if the key is not encrypted.

On servers, it is possible to call this function multiple times for the
same configuration.
This can be useful for specifying different parameters
to be used for different cryptographic algorithms.

The certificate located in _cert_ and _key_ must be NUL (`\0`) terminated C
strings containing
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468[PEM] formatted material.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available.
`NNG_EBUSY`:: The configuration _cfg_ is already in use, and cannot be modified.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: An invalid _cert_ or _key_ was supplied.
