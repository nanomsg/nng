== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_log_set_facility` is used to set the _facility_ of the application posting logs.
This is used to assist with directing log content when handled by services such as `syslog`.

Note that while the log levels used here overlap with common levels used by the syslog facility on POSIX systems, applications should not rely on this.
