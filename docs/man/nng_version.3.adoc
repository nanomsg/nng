== NAME

nng_version - report library version

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

const char * nng_version(void);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_version()` function returns a human readable ((version number))
for the _nng_ library.
This is intended for output in programs, and so forth.

Additionally, compile time version information is available
via some predefined macros:

((`NNG_MAJOR_VERSION`)):: Major version number.
((`NNG_MINOR_VERSION`)):: Minor version number.
((`NNG_PATCH_VERSION`)):: Patch version number.

The _nng_ library is developed and released using
http://www.semver.org[Semantic Versioning 2.0], and
the version numbers reported refer to both the API and the
library itself.
(The ((ABI)) -- ((application binary interface)) -- between the
library and the application is controlled in a similar, but different
manner depending upon the link options and how the library is built.)

== RETURN VALUES

C string (`NUL`-terminated) containing the library version number.

== ERRORS

None.
