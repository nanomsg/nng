== NAME

nng_ctx_close - close context

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_ctx_close(nng_ctx ctx);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_ctx_close()` function closes the context _ctx_.
Messages that have been submitted for sending may be flushed or delivered,
depending upon the transport.

Further attempts to use the context after this call returns will result
in `NNG_ECLOSED`.
Threads waiting for operations on the context when this
call is executed may also return with an `NNG_ECLOSED` result.

NOTE: Closing the socket associated with _ctx_
(using xref:nng_close.3.adoc[`nng_close()`]) also closes this context.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The context _ctx_ is already closed or was never opened.
