== NAME

nng_inproc - intra-process transport

== SYNOPSIS

[source,c]
----
#include <nng/transport/inproc/inproc.h>

int nng_inproc_register(void);
----

== DESCRIPTION

(((transport, _inproc_)))
(((intra-process)))
The ((_inproc_ transport)) provides communication support between
_nng_ sockets within the same process.
This may be used as an alternative
to slower transports when data must be moved within the same process.

This transport tries hard to avoid copying data, and thus is very
light-weight.

=== Registration

The _inproc_ transport is generally built-in to the _nng_ core, so
no extra steps to use it should be necessary.

=== URI Format
(((URI, `inproc://`)))
This transport uses URIs using the scheme `inproc://`, followed by
an arbitrary string of text, terminated by a `NUL` byte.

Multiple URIs can be used within the
same application, and they will not interfere with one another.

Two applications may also use the same URI without interfering with each
other, and they will be unable to communicate with each other using
that URI.

=== Socket Address

When using an <<nng_sockaddr.5#,`nng_sockaddr`>> structure,
the actual structure is of type
<<nng_sockaddr_inproc.5#,`nng_sockaddr_inproc`>>.

=== Transport Options

The _inproc_ transport has no special options.
