== NAME

nng_pipe_close - close pipe

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_pipe_close(nng_socket s);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_pipe_close()` function closes the supplied pipe, _p_.
Messages that have been submitted for sending may be flushed or delivered,
depending upon the transport and the setting of the
<<nng_options.5#NNG_OPT_LINGER,`NNG_OPT_LINGER`>> option.

Further attempts to use the pipe after this call returns will result
in `NNG_ECLOSED`.

TIP: Pipes are automatically closed when their creator closes, or when the
remote peer closes the underlying connection.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The pipe _p_ is already closed or was never opened.
