== NAME

nng_sockaddr_in - IPv4 socket address

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

enum sockaddr_family {
    NNG_AF_INET = 3,
};

typedef struct {
    uint16_t sa_family;
    uint16_t sa_port;
    uint32_t sa_addr;
} nng_sockaddr_in;
----

== DESCRIPTION

(((socket, address, IPv4)))
An `nng_sockaddr_in` is the flavor of <<nng_sockaddr.5#,`nng_sockaddr`>>
used to represent TCP (and sometimes UDP) addresses,
including the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number.(((port number, TCP)))

This structure is used with IPv4 addresses.
A different structure, <<nng_sockaddr_in6.5#,`nng_sockaddr_in6`>>, is used
for IPv6 addresses.

The following structure members are present:

`sa_family`::
    This field will always have the value ((`NNG_AF_INET`)).

`sa_port`::
    This field holds the TCP or UDP port number, in network byte-order.
    A zero value here is used when no specific port number is indicated.

`sa_addr`::
    This field holds the ((IP addresss))(((address, IPv4))) in
    network-byte order.

TIP: The `sa_port` and `sa_addr` fields are in network-byte order to
facilitate their use with system APIs such as `inet_ntop()`.
Most platforms use some form of BSD-derived network API, which uses
network-byte order in the various structurs (such as `sockaddr_in`).

IMPORTANT: This field appears similar to BSD `sockaddr_in`, but it is
_not_ the same, and they may not be used interchangeabley.
