== NAME

nng_close - close socket

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_close(nng_socket s);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_close()` function closes the supplied socket, _s_.
Messages that have been submitted for sending may be flushed or delivered,
depending upon the transport and the setting of the
<<nng_options.5#NNG_OPT_LINGER,`NNG_OPT_LINGER`>> option.

Further attempts to use the socket after this call returns will result
in `NNG_ECLOSED`.
Threads waiting for operations on the socket when this
call is executed may also return with an `NNG_ECLOSED` result.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The socket _s_ is already closed or was never opened.
