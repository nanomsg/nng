== DESCRIPTION

(((socket, address)))(((address, socket)))
An `nng_sockaddr` is a structure used for
representing the addresses used by underlying transports, such as TCP/IP
addresses, IPC paths, and so forth.

****
The name `sockaddr` is based on it's similarity with POSIX `struct sockaddr`,
but in the _nng_ library, these addreses are more closely affiliated with
instances of <<nng_pipe.5#,`nng_pipe`>>
than of <<nng_socket.5#,`nng_socket`>>.
The naming confusion is unfortunate.
****

This structure is actually a union, with different members for different
types of addreses.

Every member structure has as its first element a `uint16_t` field
containing the "`((address family))`".
This overlaps the `s_family` member of the union, and indicates which
specific member should be used.

The values of `s_family` are as follows:

`NNG_AF_UNSPEC`::
    Invalid address, no other valid fields.
`NNG_AF_INPROC`::
    Address for intraprocess communication (<<nng_inproc.7#,nng_inproc(7)>>).
    The `s_inproc` member is valid.
`NNG_AF_IPC`::
    Address for interprocess communication (<<nng_ipc.7#,nng_ipc(7)>>).
    The `s_path` member is valid.
`NNG_AF_INET`::
    Address for TCP/IP (v4) communication.
    The `s_in` member is valid.
`NNG_AF_INET6`::
    Address for TCP/IP (v6) communication.
    The `s_in6` member is valid.
`NNG_AF_ZT`::
    Address for ZeroTier transport (<<nng_zerotier.7#,nng_zerotier(7)>>).
    The `s_zt` member is valid.

Please see the manual pages for each individual type for more information.
