== NAME

nng_push - push protocol

== SYNOPSIS

[source,c]
----------
#include <nng/protocol/pipeline0/push.h>

int nng_push0_open(nng_socket *s);
----------

== DESCRIPTION

(((protocol, _push_)))
The ((_push_ protocol)) is one half of a ((pipeline pattern)).
The other side is the <<nng_pull.7#,_pull_>> protocol.

In the pipeline pattern, pushers distribute messages to pullers. 
Each message sent by a pusher will be sent to one of its peer pullers,
chosen in a round-robin fashion
from the set of connected peers available for receiving.
This property makes this pattern useful in ((load-balancing)) scenarios.

=== Socket Operations

The <<nng_push_open.3#,`nng_push0_open()`>> call creates a pusher socket.
This socket may be used to send messages, but is unable to receive them.
Attempts to receive messages will result in `NNG_ENOTSUP`.

Send operations will observe flow control (back-pressure), so that
only peers capable of accepting a message will be considered.
If no peer is available to receive a message, then the send operation will
wait until one is available, or the operation times out.

NOTE: Although the pipeline protocol honors flow control, and attempts
to avoid dropping messages, no guarantee of delivery is made.
Furthermore, as there is no capability for message acknowledgement,
applications that need reliable delivery are encouraged to consider the
<<nng_req.7#,_req_>> protocol instead.

=== Protocol Versions

Only version 0 of this protocol is supported.
(At the time of writing, no other versions of this protocol have been defined.)

=== Protocol Options

The _push_ protocol has no protocol-specific options.

=== Protocol Headers

The _push_ protocol has no protocol-specific headers.
