== NAME

nng_recvmsg - recv message

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
-----------
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_recvmsg(nng_socket s, nng_msg **msgp, int flags);
-----------

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_recvmsg()` receives a message on socket _s_, storing the
received message at the location pointed to by _msgp_.

TIP: Using this function gives access to the message structure, and thus may
offer more functionality than the simpler <<nng_recv.3#,`nng_recv()`>> function.

The _flags_ may contain the following value:

`NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK`::
  The function returns immediately, even if no message is available.
  Without   this flag, the function will wait until a message is received
  by the socket   _s_, or any configured timer expires.

NOTE: The semantics of what receiving a message means vary from protocol to
protocol, so examination of the protocol documentation is encouraged.
(For example, with an <<nng_req.7#,_req_>> socket a message may only be received
after a request has been sent, and an <<nng_sub.7#,_sub_>> socket
may only receive messages corresponding to topics to which it has subscribed.)
Furthermore, some protocols may not support receiving data at all, such as
<<nng_pub.7#,_pub_>>.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

`NNG_EAGAIN`:: The socket _s_ cannot accept data for sending.
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The socket _s_ is not open.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: An invalid set of _flags_ was specified.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available.
`NNG_ENOTSUP`:: The protocol for socket _s_ does not support receiving.
`NNG_ESTATE`:: The socket _s_ cannot receive data in this state.
