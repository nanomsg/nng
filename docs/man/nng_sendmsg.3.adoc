== NAME

nng_sendmsg - send message

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

int nng_sendmsg(nng_socket s, nng_msg *msg, int flags);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_sendmsg()` sends message _msg_ using the socket _s_. 

If the function returns zero, indicating it has accepted the message for
delivery, then the _msg_ is "`owned`" by the socket _s_, and the caller
must not make any further use of it.
The socket will free the message when it is finished.

If the function returns non-zero, then it is the caller's responsibility
to dispose of the _msg_, which may include freeing it, sending it to
another socket, or simply trying again later.

TIP: Using this function gives access to the message structure, and may
offer more functionality than the simpler <<nng_send.3#,`nng_send()`>> function.

NOTE: The semantics of what sending a message means vary from protocol to
protocol, so examination of the protocol documentation is encouraged.
(For example, with a <<nng_pub.7#,_pub_>> socket the data is broadcast, so that
any peers who have a suitable subscription will be able to receive it using
<<nng_recv.3#,`nng_recv()`>> or a similar function.)
Furthermore, some protocols may not support sending (such as
<<nng_sub.7#,_sub_>>) or may require other conditions.
(For example, <<nng_rep.7#,_rep_>> sockets cannot normally send data, which
are responses to requests, until they have first received a request.)

The _flags_ may contain the following value:

`NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK`::
    The function returns immediately, regardless of whether
    the socket is able to accept the data or not.
    If the socket is unable to accept the data (such as if backpressure exists
    because the peers are consuming messages too slowly, or no peer is present),
    then the function will return with `NNG_EAGAIN`.
    If this flag is not specified, then the function will block if such a
    condition exists.


NOTE: Regardless of the presence or absence of `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK`, there may
be queues between the sender and the receiver.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the message has actually been delivered.
Finally, with some protocols, the semantic is implictly `NNG_FLAG_NONBLOCK`,
such as with <<nng_pub.7#,_pub_>> sockets, which are best-effort delivery only.

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

`NNG_EAGAIN`:: The socket _s_ cannot accept data for sending.
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The socket _s_ is not open.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: An invalid set of _flags_ was specified.
`NNG_EMSGSIZE`:: The value of _size_ is too large.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available.
`NNG_ENOTSUP`:: The protocol for socket _s_ does not support sending.
`NNG_ESTATE`:: The socket _s_ cannot send data in this state.
