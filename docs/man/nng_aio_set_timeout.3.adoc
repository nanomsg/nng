== NAME

nng_aio_set_timeout - set asynchronous I/O timeout

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

typedef int nng_duration;
void nng_aio_set_timeout(nng_aio *aio, nng_duration timeout);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_aio_set_timeout()` function sets a _timeout_(((timeout)))
for the asynchronous operation associated with _aio_.
This causes a timer to be started when the operation is actually started.
If the timer expires before the operation is completed, then it is
aborted with an error of `NNG_ETIMEDOUT`.
The _timeout_ is specified as a relative number of milliseconds.

If the timeout is `NNG_DURATION_INFINITE`, then no timeout is used.
If the timeout is `NNG_DURATION_DEFAULT`, then a "default" or socket-specific
timeout is used.
(This is frequently the same as `NNG_DURATION_INFINITE`.)

TIP: As most operations involve some context switching, it is usually a good
idea to allow at least a few tens of milliseconds before timing them out --
a too small timeout might not allow the operation to properly begin before
giving up!

The value of _timeout_ set for the _aio_ is persistent, so that if the
handle is reused for multiple operations, they will have the same relative
timeout.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

None.
