== NAME

nng_http_server_release - release HTTP server instance

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
-----------
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/http/http.h>

void nng_http_server_release(nng_http_server *server);
-----------

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_http_server_release()` releases an instance of an HTTP _server_
that was previously held with
<<nng_http_server_hold.3http#,`nng_http_server_hold()`>>.

This effectively drops the reference count on the server instance.  When
the reference count drops to zero, then the _server_ and all resources
associated with it (e.g. HTTP handlers, connections, etc.) are deallocated.
(If the server is "running" when this occurs, then the server is stopped.)

IMPORTANT: It is an error to release an instance of a server that has
not previously been held, or to attempt to release an instance more
times than it has been held.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

None.
