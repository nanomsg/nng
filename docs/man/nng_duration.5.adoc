== DESCRIPTION

An `nng_duration`(((duration))) is a relative time, measured in
milliseconds.
This type is most often used in conjuction with timers and timeouts.

A couple of special values have been set aside, and carry special meanings.

((`NNG_DURATION_DEFAULT`)):::
Indicates a context-specific default value should be used.

((`NNG_DURATION_INFINITE`)):::
Effectively an infinite duration; used most often to disable timeouts.

((`NNG_DURATION_ZERO`)):::
Zero length duration; used to perform a single polling operation.
