== DESCRIPTION

These functions provide support for managing tables of data based on
identifiers, ensuring that identifiers are allocated uniquely and within
specified range limits.

The table stores data pointers (which must not be `NULL`) at a logical numeric index.
It does so efficiently, even if large gaps exist, and it provides a means to efficiently
allocate a numeric identifier from a pool of unused identifiers.

Identifiers are allocated in increasing order, without reusing old identifiers until the
largest possible identifier is allocated.  After wrapping, only identifiers that are no longer
in use will be considered.
No effort to order the availability of identifiers based on when they were freed is made.

An initial table is allocated with `nng_id_map_alloc()`, which takes the lowest legal identifier in _lo_,
and the largest legal identifier in _hi_.
The new table is returned in _map_p_, and should be used as the _map_ argument to the rest of these functions.

****
As a special convenience, if these are specified as zero, then a full range of 32-bit identifiers is assumed.
If identifiers larger than or equal to 2^32^ are required, then both _lo_ and _hi_ must be specified with the
exact values desired.
****

The _flags_ argument is a bit mask of flags for the table.
If `NNG_MAP_RANDOM` is specified, then the starting point for allocations is randomized, but subsequent allocations will then be monotonically increasing.
This is useful to reduce the odds of different instances of an application using the same identifiers at the same time.

The `nng_id_get()` function returns the value previously stored with the given identifier.
If no value is currently associated with the identifer, it returns `NULL`.

The `nng_id_set()` function sets the value with the associated identifier.
This can be used to replace a previously allocated identifier.
If the identifier was not previously allocated, then it is allocated as part of the call.
This function does not necessarily honor the identifier range limits set for the map when it was allocated.

The `nng_id_alloc()` function allocates a new identifier from the range for the map, and associates it with
the supplied _value_.

The `nng_id_remove()` function removes the identifier and its associated value from the table.

NOTE: These functions are limited to storing at most 2^32^ identifiers, even though the identifers may
themselves be larger than 2^32^.

IMPORTANT: These functions are *not* thread-safe.
Callers should use a xref:nng_mtx_lock.3supp[mutex] or similar approach when thread-safety is needed.

== RETURN VALUES

The `nng_id_map_alloc()`, `nng_id_set()`, `nng_id_alloc()`, and `nng_id_remove()` functions
return 0 on success, or -1 on failure.

The `nng_id_map_get()` function returns the requested data pointer, or `NULL` if the identifier was not found.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`NNG_ENOENT`:: The _id_ does not exist in the table.
`NNG_ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available, or the table is full.
