== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_http_res_set_version()` sets the HTTP protocol version associated with
the response _res_ to _version_.
The _version_ must be a string containing
a valid HTTP protocol version, such as "HTTP/1.0".
The default value is "HTTP/1.1".

A local copy of the _version_ is made in the response _res_.

NOTE: No validation of the version supplied is performed.

NOTE: The library does not contain support for versions of HTTP other than
"HTTP/1.0" and "HTTP/1.1".
Specifying any other version may result in unspecified behavior.
