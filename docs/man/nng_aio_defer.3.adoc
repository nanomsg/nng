== NAME

nng_aio_defer - defer asynchronous I/O operation

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>

typedef void (*nng_aio_cancelfn)(nng_aio *aio, void *arg, int err);

void nng_aio_defer(nng_aio *aio, nng_aio_cancelfn fn, void *arg);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_aio_defer()` function marks operation associated with _aio_ as
being deferred for asynchronous completion, and also registers a cancellation
function _fn_ and associated argument _arg_, thereby
permitting the operation to be canceled.

If the _aio_ is being canceled, the cancellation routine _fn_ will be called
with the _aio_, the _arg_ specified by `nng_aio_defer()`, and an error
value in _err_, which is the reason that the operation is being canceled.

The operation may not be cancelable; for example it may have already been
completed, or be in a state where it is no longer possible to unschedule it.
In this case, the _cancelfn_ should just return without making any changes.

If the cancellation routine successfully canceled the operation, it should
ensure that `<<nng_aio_finish.3#,nng_aio_finish()>>` is called, with the
error code specified by _err_.

IMPORTANT: It is mandatory that I/O providers call
`<<nng_aio_finish.3#,nng_aio_finish()>>`
*EXACTLY ONCE* when they are finished with the operation.

NOTE: This function is only for I/O providers (those actually performing
the operation such as HTTP handler functions or transport providers); ordinary
users of the _aio_ should not call this function.

NOTE: Care must be taken to ensure that cancellation and completion of
the routine are multi-thread safe; this will usually involve the use
of locks or other synchronization primitives.

TIP: For operations that complete synchronously, without any need to be
deferred, the provider should not bother to call `nng_aio_defer()`,
although it is harmless if it does.

== RETURN VALUES

None.

== ERRORS

None.
