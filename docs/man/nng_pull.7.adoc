== NAME

nng_pull - pull protocol

== SYNOPSIS

[source,c]
----------
#include <nng/protocol/pipeline0/pull.h>

int nng_pull0_open(nng_socket *s);
----------

== DESCRIPTION

(((protocol, _pull_)))
The ((_pull_ protocol)) is one half of a ((pipeline pattern)).
The other half is the <<nng_push.7#,_push_>> protocol.

In the pipeline pattern, pushers distribute messages to pullers. 
Each message sent
by a pusher will be sent to one of its peer pullers,
chosen in a round-robin fashion
from the set of connected peers available for receiving.
This property makes this pattern useful in ((load-balancing)) scenarios.

=== Socket Operations

The <<nng_pull_open.3#,`nng_pull0_open()`>> call creates a puller socket.
This socket may be used to receive messages, but is unable to send them.
Attempts to send messages will result in `NNG_ENOTSUP`.

When receiving messages, the _pull_ protocol accepts messages as
they arrive from peers.
If two peers both have a message ready, the
order in which messages are handled is undefined.

=== Protocol Versions

Only version 0 of this protocol is supported.
(At the time of writing, no other versions of this protocol have been defined.)

=== Protocol Options

The _pull_ protocol has no protocol-specific options.

=== Protocol Headers

The _pull_ protocol has no protocol-specific headers.
