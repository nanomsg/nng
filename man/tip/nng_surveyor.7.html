<div class="paragraph">
<p>(protocol, <em>surveyor</em>)
The <em>surveyor</em> protocol is one half of a survey pattern.
In this pattern, a surveyor sends a survey, which is broadcast to all
peer respondents.
The respondents then have a chance to reply (but are not obliged to reply).
The survey itself is a timed event, so that responses
received after the survey has finished are discarded.</p>

This protocol is useful in solving voting problems, such as
leader election in cluster configurations, as well as certain kinds of
service discovery problems.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>surveyor</em> protocol is the surveyor side, and the
<a href="nng_respondent.7.html"><em>respondent</em></a> protocol is the respondent side.</p>

<h3 id="_socket_operations">Socket Operations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="nng_surveyor_open.3.html"><code>nng_surveyor0_open()</code></a>
functions create a surveyor socket.
This socket may be used to send messages (surveys), and then to receive replies.
A reply can only be received after sending a survey.
A surveyor can normally expect to receive at most one reply from each responder.
(Messages can be duplicated in some topologies,
so there is no guarantee of this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attempts to receive on a socket with no outstanding survey will result
in <code>NNG_ESTATE</code>.
If the survey times out while the surveyor is waiting
for replies, then the result will be <code>NNG_ETIMEDOUT</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only one survey can be outstanding at a time; sending another survey will
cancel the prior one, and any responses from respondents from the prior
survey that arrive after this will be discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="nng.7.html">Raw</a> mode sockets ignore all these restrictions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_context_operations">Context Operations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This protocol supports the creation of <a href="nng_ctx.5.html">contexts</a> for concurrent
use cases using <a href="nng_ctx_open.3.html"><code>nng_ctx_open()</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each context can initiate its own surveys, and it will receive only
responses to its own outstanding surveys.
Other contexts on the same socket may have overlapping surveys
operating at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these may have their own timeouts established with
<code>NNG_OPT_SURVEYOR_SURVEYTIME</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, sending a survey on a context will only cancel an outstanding
survey on the same context.</p>

<td class="content">
Due to the best-effort nature of this protocol, if too may contexts
are attempting to perform surveys simultaneously, it is possible for either
individual outgoing surveys or incoming responses to be lost.

<h3 id="_protocol_versions">Protocol Versions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only version 0 of this protocol is supported.
(At the time of writing, no other versions of this protocol have been defined.
An earlier and incompatible version of the protocol was used in older
pre-releases of
<a href="http://nanomsg.org">nanomsg</a>, but was not released in any production
version.)</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_protocol_options">Protocol Options</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following protocol-specific options is available.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>NNG_OPT_SURVEYOR_SURVEYTIME</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>(<a href="nng_duration.5.html"><code>nng_duration</code></a>) Duration of surveys.
   When a new survey is started, a timer of this duration is also started.
   Any responses arriving this time will be discarded.
   Attempts to receive
   after the timer expires with no other surveys started will result in
   <code>NNG_ESTATE</code>.
   Attempts to receive when this timer expires will result in <code>NNG_ETIMEDOUT</code>.</p>
</dd>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_protocol_headers">Protocol Headers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form uses a stack of 32-bit big-endian identifiers.
There <strong>must</strong> be at least one identifier, the <em>survey ID</em>, which will be the
last element in the array, and <strong>must</strong> have the most significant bit set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be additional <em>peer ID</em>s preceding the survey ID.
These will be distinguishable from the survey ID by having their most
significant bit clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a survey message is received by a forwarding node (see
<a href="nng_device.3.html"><code>nng_device()</code></a>), the forwarding node prepends a
32-bit peer ID (which <strong>must</strong> have the most significant bit clear),
which is the forwarder&#8217;s way of identifying the directly connected
peer from which it received the message.
(This peer ID, except for the
most significant bit, has meaning only to the forwarding node itself.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may help to think of prepending a peer ID as pushing a peer ID onto the
front of the stack of headers for the message.
(It will use the peer ID
it popped from the front to determine the next intermediate destination
for the response.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a response message is created, it is created using the same headers
that the survey contained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A forwarding node can pop the peer ID it originally pushed on the
message, stripping it from the front of the message as it does so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the response finally arrives back at the initiating surveyor, it
should have only a single element in the message, which will be the
survey ID it originally used for the request.</p>
