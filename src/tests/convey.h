/*
 * This test framework allows one to write tests as a form of assertion,
 * giving simpler and more readable test logic.
 *
 * The test framework provides a main() function.
 *
 * To use this call the Main() macro, and embed Test() and Convey() blocks.
 * These can be nested, and after each convey the entire stack is popped so
 * that execution can continue from the beginning, giving each test section
 * the same environment.
 *
 * There are assertion macros too, which don't roll back the stack, but which
 * do update the test state.
 *
 * Here's a sample file:
 *
 * Main({
 *	Test({"Integer Tests", {
 *		int x = 1; int y = 2;
 *		Convey("Addition works", func() {
 *			So(y == 2);
 *			So(y + x == 3);
 *			So(x + y == 3);
 *			Convey("Even big numbers", {
 *				y = 100;
 *				So(x + y == 101);
 *			});
 *			Convey("Notice y is still 2 in this context", {
 *				So(y == 2);
 *			});
 * 		});
 *	});
 * })
 *
 * This was inspired by GoConvey -- github.com/smartystreets/goconvey - but
 * there are differences of course -- C is not Go!
 *
 * Pleaes note that we abuse the C preprocessor and setjmp fairly heavily,
 * and as a result of the magic we have to do, a lot of these guts must be
 * exposed in this header file.  HOWEVER, only symbols beginning with a
 * capital letter are intended for consumers.  All others are for internal
 * use only.  Otherwise, welcome to the sausage factory.
 *
 * Please see the documentation at github.com/gdamore/c-convey for more
 * details about how to use this.

 *
 * Unlike with GoConvey, this must be registered before any children
 * convey blocks; the logic only affects convey blocks that follow this
 * one, within the same scope.
 *
 * This must be in a conveyRun scope (i.e. part of a Convey() or a
 * top level Test() or it will not compile.

 * It is possible to have a subsequent reset at the same convey scope
 * override a prior reset.  Normally you should avoid this, and just
